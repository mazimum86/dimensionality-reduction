# Dimensionality Reduction

This repository contains implementations of various Dimensionality Reduction techniques, which are used to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. Dimensionality reduction is commonly used in machine learning to simplify models, improve performance, and visualize high-dimensional data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in these implementations typically consists of high-dimensional data where the number of features is large. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining its essential structure and relationships.

## Contents

- **dimensionality_reduction.py**: The main script that implements various Dimensionality Reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
- **data.csv**: The dataset file used for testing the dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the code.
- **visualizations/**: A directory containing visualizations of the reduced data in 2D or 3D space.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from `data.csv` and prepared for dimensionality reduction.
2. **Standardization**: The data is standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is essential for many dimensionality reduction techniques.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
    - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduces the dimensionality by projecting the data onto the directions of maximum variance.
    - **LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)**: A supervised technique that reduces dimensionality while maintaining the separability between classes.
    - **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: A non-linear technique that is particularly good for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensions.
4. **Visualization**: The reduced data is visualized to illustrate how well the dimensionality reduction technique preserved the structure of the original data.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mazimum86/dimensionality-reduction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd dimensionality-reduction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Dimensionality Reduction script:
    ```bash
    python dimensionality_reduction.py
    ```

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using `pip`.

## Results

The output includes:

- **Reduced Data**: The dataset after applying dimensionality reduction, typically reduced to 2 or 3 dimensions.
- **Visualizations**: Plots of the reduced data, showing how the different techniques captured the structure of the original data.
